        <h2>Styr</h2>
        <p>During my internship at Rubynor, I had the privilege to work on an exciting and innovative project called Styr. Styr is a cutting-edge application designed to transform the way remote workers manage and track drawings and documents.

With the increasing trend of remote work, traditional methods of managing physical drawings and documents have become cumbersome and inefficient. Styr aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized platform where remote workers can easily access, collaborate on, and track their important project files.

The core functionality of Styr revolves around its intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload, organize, and categorize their drawings and documents effortlessly. Whether it's architectural blueprints, engineering schematics, or legal contracts, Styr ensures that remote workers have all the necessary information at their fingertips.</p>
